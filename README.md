 # Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This repository contains exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects on various datasets. EDA helps uncover patterns, trends, and insights from raw data before applying machine learning models or making business decisions.

## Steps in EDA
1. **Data Collection:** Load dataset from CSV, Excel, or other sources.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
3. **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics and distribution analysis.
4. **Data Visualization:** Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.
5. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features, encoding categorical variables.
6. **Correlation Analysis:** Understanding relationships between variables.
7. **Insights & Conclusions:** Key observations and business implications.
